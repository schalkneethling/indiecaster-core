## üìÇ RSS Import Feature

IndieCaster includes a powerful RSS import feature to migrate existing podcasts:

```bash
# Import from existing RSS feed
npm run import-rss "https://your-podcast-feed.com/rss.xml"

npm run import-rss "https://your-podcast-feed.com/rss.xml" -- --dry-run

npm run import-rss "https://your-podcast-feed.com/rss.xml" -- --verbose
```

The importer automatically:
- Creates episode files from RSS entries
- Generates host profiles from RSS metadata
- Hotlinks to external audio and artwork files
- Imports episodes as drafts for review
