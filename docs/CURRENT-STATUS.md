## Current Issues

### 1. Slug Bug (Documented)
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Impact**: Episode routing may be inconsistent
- **Next Steps**: Investigate Astro's content collection slug generation

### 2. Placeholder Files

- **Next Steps**: Replace with actual media files when available

### 3. Content Structure
- **Status**: Well-implemented with draft functionality
- **Impact**: Positive - proper content management system in place
- **Next Steps**: Add more actual episode content

## Development Server Status
- ✅ Server is running on `http://localhost:4321/`
- ✅ Content collections are syncing correctly
- ✅ Pages are loading (200 responses for main routes)
- ✅ Draft functionality is implemented and working
- ⚠️ Some 404 errors for media files (resolved with 1-byte placeholders)

## Next Steps

### Immediate

2. Verify that 404 errors are resolved
3. Test episode navigation
4. Test draft episode functionality

### Short Term
