# Indie Podcaster Focus

## Core Mission
IndieCaster is designed to make managing a podcast as simple and impactful as possible. Indie podcasters have a LOT to do, so this product should always aim to make their lives easier.

## Key Principles

### 1. Start Simple, Grow Gradually
- **Essentials First**: Users can start with just 3 files (show cover, audio, guest photos)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Add more artwork and features as the podcast grows
- **No Overwhelm**: Avoid requiring everything upfront

### 2. Platform-Agnostic Design
- **Generic Naming**: Use industry-standard terms, not platform-specific names
- **Universal Compatibility**: Work across all major podcast platforms
- **Future-Proof**: Don't tie to specific platform requirements

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligence
- **Automatic Selection**: System chooses appropriate artwork for each context
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when optional artwork isn't available
- **Performance Optimized**: WebP support, lazy loading, responsive design

### 4. Practical Documentation
- **User-Focused**: Write for busy podcasters, not developers
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with essentials, expand as needed
- **Real-World Examples**: Show actual use cases and decision points

## User Experience Guidelines

### For New Podcasters
- **Minimal Setup**: Get started with just show cover + audio files
- **Clear Paths**: Know exactly what to add and when

### For Growing Podcasts

## Development Priorities

### Always Consider
1. **Simplicity**: Can this be made simpler?
2. **Impact**: Does this make the podcast more discoverable/engaging?
3. **Time**: Does this save the podcaster time?
4. **Quality**: Does this improve the professional appearance?

### Avoid
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't add complexity without clear benefit
- **Platform Lock-in**: Don't tie to specific platforms unnecessarily
- **Technical Jargon**: Don't confuse users with unnecessary technical details
- **All-or-Nothing**: Don't require everything to be perfect from day one

## Content Strategy

### Documentation Tone
- **Encouraging**: "You can do this!" not "You must do this"
- **Practical**: Real-world advice, not theoretical perfection
- **Progressive**: Start here, grow from here
- **Supportive**: Resources and help for non-designers

### Feature Design
- **Defaults**: Sensible defaults that work well
- **Optional**: Most features should be optional enhancements
- **Discoverable**: Users should find features when they need them
- **Forgiving**: Graceful handling of missing or imperfect content
